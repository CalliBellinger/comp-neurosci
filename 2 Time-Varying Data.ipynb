    "\n",
    "- A **time series** is a quantitative physical property of a system measured over a time interval. In digital computers, time series data are always sampled at discrete moments in time, usually at fixed intervals. The *sampling rate* of the data is the number of times per second the underlying process was measured. Examples of time series include sound waveforms and recordings of extracellular voltage.\n",

Movements in this fluid are detected by hair cells, which transduce the sound into neural signals. Sound can be recorded with a microphone, which transduces pressure changes into electrical voltage changes. These in turn can be sampled by a digitizer and turned into an array of numbers. This means that a sound recording is a **time series**.\n",

To get full credit, you may not copy and paste your code however many times it takes to go through all the stimuli. You will need to use for loops, functions, or both. In addition to the resources linked above, you can consult the Software Carpentry chapters on [Looping through Data Sets](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/13-looping-data-sets/) and [Writing Functions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/14-writing-functions/).\n",
