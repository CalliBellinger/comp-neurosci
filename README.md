# Data Science for Neuroscientists

This repository contains instructional materials for learning scientific programming and data science skills in neuroscience. This is a work in progress, but the following modules are complete:

- how to represent and store observations of neurons
- descriptive statistics of neural spike trains

## Getting started

Instructions needed here on how to run the notebooks locally or on a kubernetes jupyterhub installation.
