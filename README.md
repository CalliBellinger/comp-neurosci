# Data Science for Neuroscientists

This repository contains instructional materials for learning scientific programming and data science skills in neuroscience. This is a work in progress, but the following modules are complete:

- how to represent and store observations of neurons
- descriptive statistics of neural spike trains
- coding and decoding models
- dynamical systems models of neurons and circuits

## Getting started

The reading assignments and exercises make extensive use of Python, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, collectively known as a scipy stack. Installation instructions [here](http://www.scipy.org/install.html)

To work on a problem set, run `ipython notebook` from the `assignments` subdirectory. A new tab should open in your browser that lets you open and work on a notebook.
