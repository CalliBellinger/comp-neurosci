    "Let's go through some important concepts. A neuron's **selectivity** is a measure of how sparsely it responds to a broad selection of stimuli. In other words, when tested with a large number of stimuli, a highly selective neuron would respond strongly to only a few stimuli and weakly to all the others. In contrast, a weakly selective neuron responds similarly to many stimuli.\n",

Note how the structures around those note are similar too. This pattern is so common in starling song that we call these repeated elements **motifs**. For this exercise, we'll be using motifs to analyze selectivity.\n",
