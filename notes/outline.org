* Introduction
** course goals
** help students install Python environment
** basic neurobiology: anatomy, physiology, sensory and motor systems
** computational models: generative vs statistical; level of detail

* Time series data
** concepts:
*** sampled vs point process
*** sampling rate and bit depth
** experimental:
*** electrophysiology (intracellular, single unit, EEG)
*** optical
*** behavioral
** data types in digital computers:
*** binary data and logic
*** atomic data types (integers, floats, characters)
*** composite data types (strings, arrays, dictionaries)

* Best practices in software and open science
** principles of open science
*** open formats
*** open source code
*** reproducible workflows (dependency management and version control)
*** test-driven development
** introduction to algorithms in Python
*** variables, functions, conditional control, loops
*** modules, packages, and environments

* Working with (big) data
** observation as a semi-random process
*** distributions
** reading and writing data from disk and the Internet
*** data structures in Python
*** external libraries and dependency management
** data sets for student practice:
*** single-unit responses to auditory stimuli (starling dataset)
*** single-unit responses during behavior (from CRCNS; pfc or hippocampus)
*** calcium imaging set (from CRCNS; e.g. pvc-7)
*** EEG data during a basic sensory task (e.g. MMN?)
*** multiple single units
*** show students how to navigate CRCNS site to choose their own

* Model-guided visualization
** the rate model of neural spiking
*** histograms
*** linear convolution
** basic 1D visualization
*** line and scatter plots
*** principles of good data visualization
** building composable workflows
*** version control
*** scripting

* Linear time-invariant systems
** time-domain signal processing
*** filtering, correlation
** Fourier transformation
*** time-frequency tradeoff
*** coherence
** basic 2D visualization
*** data: EEG, bioacoustic recordings, spikes
*** color maps
*** aligning plots for multiple time series
